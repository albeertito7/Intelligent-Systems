Reinforcement Learning

- learn how to act over time based on own experiences

Basic idea:
    - Receive feedback in the form of rewards
    - Agent's utility is defined by the reward function
    - Must (learn to) act so as to maximize expected rewards
    - All learning is based on observed samples of outcomes!

- we have an agent as always
- the agent has actions available, and chose one
- the environment affects the transition between state s and s'
- finally the agent receives back two things: the reward (could be a bonus or a penalty) and the sate s'


- Still assume Markov decision process (MDP)
    - a set of states s
    - a set of actions a (per state)
    - a model T(s,a,s')
    - a reward function R(s,a,s')
- still looking for a policy
