Reinforcement Learning II

- We stull assume an MDP:
    - a set of states s
    - a set of actions a (per state)
    - a model transition T(s,a,s')
    - a reward function R(s,a,s')

- Still looking for a policy
- New twist: don't know T or R, so must try out actions

- Big Idea: Compute all averages over T using sample outcomes
