Markov Decision Processes
    - way to formalize the idea of non-deterministic search

Non-Deterministic Search
    - when action outcomes are uncertain
    - the outcome isn't entirely under our control

Grid World
    - Maze-like problem
        - the agent lives in a grid
        - the walls block the agent's path
    - Noisy movement
        - actions do not always go as planned
    - the agent receives rewards each time step
        - small "living" reward each step (can be negative)
        - big rewards come at the end (good or bad)
    - two kind of rewards
        1. terminal utilities
        2. each step
            - positive: walking is happier
            - negative: will cost pain every step and you want things to end quickly
    - Agent's Goal:
        - Maximize the sum of rewards

Deterministic Grid World
    - action North -> outcome = North

Non-Deterministic/Stochastic Grid World
    - action North -> outcome?
        - 80% North
        - 10% West
        - 10% East
    - action affected by the ENVIRONMENT

**When planning we must take into account all the possible outcomes, and if they are worth it**
