Uncertainty and Utilities

- How you should plan when the actions' outcome is not entirely under your control?
- Idea: uncertain outcomes controlled by chance, and not by an adversary!


- if u play against a perfect adversary (optimal) -> it is possible to predict its next move
- but if there is a chance/probability -> the prediction needs to depend on this


- Why wouldn't we know what the result of an action will be?
    - explicit randomness: rolling dice
    - unpredictable adversaries: the ghosts respond randomly
    - actions can fail: when moving a robot, wheels might slip

- any action taken will have some uncertainty
    - values should now reflext average-case outcomes, not worst-case (optimal) (minimax) outcomes
    - replace all the min values by averages

- now matter how well is played, who knows what is gonna happen when the dice roll
- compute whatever actions are gonna give the best outcome on average
